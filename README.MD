## Installing

Everyone can install this module from **PowerShellGallery** hosted by Microsoft. It's recommended way to work with the module.
Version on **PowershellGallery** is optimized for speed and signed. Using code from **GitHub** is **recommended for development**.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PasswordSolution -AllowClobber -Force -Verbose
```

If you want to use Password Quality checks you need to install DSInternals manually.
Due to sensitive nature of the module it's not included in the package.

```powershell
Install-Module DSInternals -Force -Verbose
```

Force and AllowClobber aren't necessary, but they do skip errors in case some appear, and they do update module if newer version is available.

## Updating

```powershell
Update-Module -Name PasswordSolution
```

That's it. Whenever there's a new version, you run the command, and you can enjoy it. Remember that you may need to close, reopen PowerShell session if you have already used module before updating it.

**The essential thing** is if something works for you on production, keep using it till you test the new version on a test computer. I do changes that may not be big, but big enough that auto-update may break your code. For example, small rename to a parameter and your code stops working! Be responsible!

## Usage - Password Quality

Password Quality report uses [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals) module to scan Active Directory for passwords and then assesses them.
It's a very powerful tool that can be used to find weak passwords in your environment.
It's also a great tool to find out if your password policy is working as expected.
PasswordSolution wraps around DSInternals to make it easier to use and to provide a nice HTML report.

```powershell
Show-PasswordQuality -FilePath C:\Temp\PasswordQuality.html -Online -WeakPasswords "Test1", "Test2", "Test3" -Verbose -SeparateDuplicateGroups -AddWorldMap -PassThru
```

or

```powershell
$showPasswordQualitySplat = @{
    FilePath                = "$PSScriptRoot\Reporting\PasswordQuality_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MM-dd_HHmmss).html"
    WeakPasswords           = "Test1", "Test2", "Test3", 'February2023!#!@ok', $Passwords | ForEach-Object { $_ }
    SeparateDuplicateGroups = $true
    PassThru                = $true
    AddWorldMap             = $true
    LogPath                 = "$PSScriptRoot\Logs\PasswordQuality_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MM-dd_HHmmss).log"
    Online                  = $true
    LogMaximum              = 5
}

Show-PasswordQuality @showPasswordQualitySplat -Verbose
```
